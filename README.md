This repository contains my notes taken while working my way through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) alongside a general transcription of the book's contents.

With a few exceptions, each chapter of the Rust Book has been given its own crate.

While largely a 1:1 transcription of the Rust Book, my notes also feature interspersed ramblings from my own understanding of how Rust functions and putting concepts into my own words.
